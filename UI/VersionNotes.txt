<color #FF8800>PSv1.1 (15/JUL/20)</color>
<color yellow>- Added multi-replace support: You can choose a bunch of possible props/trees to replace</color>
You can configure them to randomize by building/segment, or set it to be fully randomized. Can be very useful to easily generate a randomized forest!

<color yellow>- Added rotation offset support to props</color>
Trees unsuported due to lack of game code support for that.

<color yellow>- Minor fixes</color>
	> Trees names on search now are the same from ingame UI
	> Fixed illumination properties when replacing a prop
	> Added support to props with effects

<color gray>UPDATE r1 (06/JUL/20)
	- Fixed: Throwing exception if try to remove trees
	- Fixed: Throwing exception sometimes when loading a city
	- Fixed: Custom props when selected in "target to replace" field show trees instead of props in the list of available replacement
	- Changed Behavior: Now allow replace a prop/tree by itself (useful to override global files)
	- Added to buildings and networks list also the Global Configurations from files:
		- GREEN if active
		- RED if overriden in the savegame
	- Added typeable filters in the replacement list (by target to replace, replacement) and also a dropdown to filter rule source (for networks and buildings)
