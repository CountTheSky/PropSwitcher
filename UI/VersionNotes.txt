<color #FF8800>PSv1.3 (11/MAR/21)</color>
- Ensured that ArrayOutOfRangeException error won't happen anymore
- Added support to edit subbuildings props (now you will be able to pick them with the building picker tool)
- Fixed UI: Now the rules are paged and only 5 are shown per loading by default (can be configured, but a higher value can cause game slowdown - like it used to happen in older versions)
- Fixed UI: Now the filters will be applied in a smarter way, preventing screen freezes
- Now this mod costs <color green>nothing</color> to game's FPS performance, since it only will calculate the replacements once and then cache the results for rendering.
- <color yellow>NEW FEATURE:</color> Now you can edit position offsets for individual instances of props and trees in buildings. Search by <color cyan>"Prop #"</color> or the prop name at the prop to replace text input to list them.
	<color red>IMPORTANT!</color> Height adjustment only will work for some props placed on wall. Props on ground probably won't be affected!
	<color cyan>NOTE:</color> Net segments don't have this feature by now, and it won't be supported globally.
- Fixed compatibility with some mods made by kian.zarrin. (and possibly others that deals with trees in roads)
- Fixed: Search names weren't matching game's props/trees names.

<color yellow>r1: Fixed terrain trees not being affected by rules</color>
