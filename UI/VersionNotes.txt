<color #FF0000>Update r1 (18/JUL/20): Tree support temporarily removed! May be back in next patch</color>

<color #FF8800>PSv1.1 (18/JUL/20)</color>
<color yellow>- Added multi-replace support: You can choose a bunch of possible props/trees to replace</color>
You can configure them to randomize by building/segment, or set it to be fully randomized. Can be very useful to easily generate a randomized forest!
<color cyan>NOTE:</color> Due some deep changes, all previously made changes that had as target to remove a tree or prop will be erased on first load.

<color yellow>- Added rotation offset support to props</color>
Trees unsuported due to lack of game code support for that.

<color yellow>- Minor fixes</color>
	> Trees names on search now are the same from ingame UI
	> Fixed illumination properties when replacing a prop
	> Added support to props with effects
