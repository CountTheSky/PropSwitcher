<color=yellow>r1 (6/MAR/21):</color> Fixed compatibility with some mods made by kian.zarrin. (and possibly others that deals with trees in roads)

<color gray>- Added multi-replace support: You can choose a bunch of possible props/trees to replace
You can configure them to randomize by building/segment, or set it to be fully randomized. Can be very useful to easily generate a randomized forest!
<color cyan>NOTE:</color> Due some deep changes, all previously made changes that had as target to remove a tree or prop will be erased on first load.

- Added rotation offset support to props
Trees unsuported due to lack of game code support for that.

- Minor fixes
	> Trees names on search now are the same from ingame UI
	> Fixed illumination properties when replacing a prop
	> Added support to props with effects</color>
